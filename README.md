# WatLab Setup Guide (Step-by-Step)


### Steps to Set Up WatLab:

1. **Download and Extract Required Files**  
   - Download the file **`open_channel_2024_fall-main.zip`** from the website or directly using this [link](https://github.com/damiel-hub/open_channel_2024_fall/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  
   - Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your preferred directory.

2. **Install WatLab and Its Dependencies**  
   - Open the **Anaconda Prompt** on your computer.  
   - Navigate to the directory **`open_channel_2024_fall-main\W13_environment_setup`** using the `cd` command. Replace `to_your_path` with the actual path to the extracted folder:  
     ```bash
     cd to_your_path\open_channel_2024_fall-main\W13_environment_setup
     ```  
   - **Note:** If the folder is on a different drive (e.g., D:), switch to that drive first by typing the drive letter followed by a colon (`:`):  
     ```bash
     D:
     ```  
   - Run the following commands to create and set up the WatLab environment:  
     ```bash
     conda create --name watlab python=3.11
     conda activate watlab
     python -m pip install GDAL-3.4.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
     python -m pip install watlab
     ```

3. **Install a C++ Compiler**  
   - Download and install a C++ compiler from [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/). Follow the installation instructions provided on their website.  
   - Add the MSYS2 binary path (default: `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`) to your system's environment variables:  
     - Open the "Run" dialog by pressing `Windows + R`, type `SystemPropertiesAdvanced`, and hit Enter.  
     - Use the Environment Variable Manager to add the path.

4. **Modify the `watlab.py` Code**  
   - Open the `watlab.py` script located in `open_channel_2024_fall-main\W13_environment_setup`.  
   - Replace its content with the original code.

5. **Run WatLab**  
   - Open the **`watlab-first-script.py`** file using VS Code.  
   - Open a terminal within VS Code and activate the WatLab environment:  
     ```bash
     conda activate watlab
     ```  
   - Navigate to the script directory:  
     ```bash
     cd .\open_channel_2024_fall-main\W13_environment_setup\watlab-first-script
     ```  
   - Run the script with the following command:  
     ```bash
     python watlab-first-script.py
     ```  

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and run WatLab.
